This project is HelloApp, mostly auto-generated by Gemini Code Assist.

## Running with Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Stopping the services

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Running with Kubernetes (Rancher Desktop)

1.  **Build container images:**
    Build the images and load them into Rancher Desktop's container runtime.

    ```bash
    nerdctl --namespace k8s.io build -t helloservice:latest -f HelloService/Containerfile .
    nerdctl --namespace k8s.io build -t helloapp:latest -f HelloApp/Containerfile .
    ```

2.  **Deploy to Kubernetes:**
    Apply the Kubernetes manifests.

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f k8s-manifests.yaml
    ```

3.  **Check status:**
    Wait for the pods to be in the `Running` state and for services to get an external IP.

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -w
    kubectl get services
    kubectl get deployments
    ```

4.  **Access the application:**
    Once the `helloapp` service has an `EXTERNAL-IP` (it should be `localhost`), you can access the application at `http://localhost:8080`.

    The `helloservice` will be accessible at `http://localhost:5268`.

5.  **Clean up:**
    To remove the deployed services from Kubernetes:

    ```bash
    kubectl delete -f k8s-manifests.yaml
    ```
